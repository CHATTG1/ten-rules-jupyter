# Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Research with Jupyter Notebooks

This repository is an adjunct to the "Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Research with Jupyter Notebook" paper [ref].

The example notebooks demonstrate some of rules. 

## Example 1
This example demonstrates a 4-step workflow for predicting the protein fold type using a Machine Learning approach.

You can launch the top level notebook directly in your web browser: [0-Workflow.ipynb](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyter-guide/ten-rules-jupyter/master?filepath=example1%2F0-Workflow.ipynb).

Then follow the steps in the notebook to run the 4 steps of the workflow.

## Example 2


## How do I run a Juypter Notebook from this site?
The Jupyter notebook links on this page launch the notebooks in your web browser without software installation using Binder ([mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/)), an experimental platform for reproducible research (The Binder servers can be slow or may not be available).

After you click on a notebook link above, you see a spinning Binder logo. Wait until the notebook launches (this may take a few minutes). Then click the Run ">>" button to execute the cells in the notebook.
