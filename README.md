# Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Research with Jupyter Notebooks

This repository is an adjunct to the "Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Research with Jupyter Notebook" paper [ref].

The example notebooks demonstrate some of rules. 

## Example 1
This example demonstrates a reproducible 4-step workflow for predicting a protein fold classification using a Machine Learning approach.

**Rule 8: Prepare Your Notebooks to Be Read, Run, and Explored.** The nbviewer links provide to a non-interactive preview of notebooks and ![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg) buttons launch
notebooks in your web browser using the Binder ([mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/)) server (may be slow!). All notebooks can also be launched directly from the links in the 0-Workflow.ipynb top-level notebook.

**Rule 7: Share Your Data and Explain How to Use It.** To enable reproducibility, we provide a example1/data directory with all data required to run the workflow. A description of the data with download location and download date is [available](./example1/data/Datasets.md).

## How do I run Notebooks from this Site?
The Launch Binder links on this page launch notebooks in your web browser without software installation using Binder ([mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/)), an experimental platform for reproducible research (The Binder servers may be slow or not available intermittently).

After you click on a launch link above, you see a spinning Binder logo. Wait until the notebook launches (this may take a few minutes). Then click the Run ">>" button to execute the cells in the notebook.
